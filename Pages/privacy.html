    <h1>Message Header Analyzer</h1>
    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    This <a href="https://store.office.com/en-001/app.aspx?assetid=WA104005406" target="_blank">add-in</a> does not collect or transmit any user information.
    Please refer any questions to the MHA <a href="https://github.com/stephenegriffin/MHA/issues/" target="_blank">project</a> on GitHub.<br />
    <br />
    <h2>Installation Procedure</h2>
    Because MHA requires the ReadWriteMailbox permission (see below) it can only be installed by the Administrator through the Exchange admin center. Here are some steps I put together:
    <ul>
        <li>In Office365, go to the Exchange Admin Center.</li>
        <li>Click on the Organization tab</li>
        <li>From there, select the add-ins tab</li>
        <li>Click the Plus icon/Add from the Office Store</li>
        <li>A new page will load for the store</li>
        <li>Search for "Message Header Analyzer"</li>
        <li>Choose MHA in the results</li>
        <li>Click Add</li>
        <li>Confirm by clicking Yes</li>
        <li>Back in the Exchange Admin Center, refresh the list of add-ins</li>
        <li>You can now edit who the add-in is available for</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h2>A Note from the Developer on Permissions</h2>
    In order to get the transport message headers I have to use the EWS makeEwsRequestAsync method, which requires the ReadWriteMailbox permission level. See the article
    <a href="https://dev.office.com/docs/add-ins/outlook/understanding-outlook-add-in-permissions" target="_blank">Understanding Outlook add-in permissions</a>
    for more on this. If I could request fewer permissions I would, since I only ever read the one property, but I have no choice in the matter.<br />
    <br />
    When REST is more widely available, and a few REST specific bugs are fixed, I'll be able to switch to REST and request a lower permission level.<br />
